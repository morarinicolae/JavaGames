# Java-Labyrinth-Game

This is an old school project made with Java, featuring a labyrinth game with randomized labyrinth and solver algorithms. The game is pretty much complete, only issue I know of was in highscores when player gives his name with ':' character.

I did this project during my early studies, so the code is messy and includes finnish words.

Only source code and images available at the moment.
